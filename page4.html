<div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement was recently said by “Eat Bulaga” main host Joey de Leon as he drew flak after dismissing depression as “gawa-gawa lang (made up by the person suffering from it).” Though he had apologized and subsequently suspended himself from the show, the fact that there are people like him who think of mental illnesses like depression was just a sickness made up by a person was truly saddening.

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-4"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Health Organization (WHO) defines depression as a common mental disorder, characterized by sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, feelings of tiredness, and poor concentration.
</p><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these symptoms may seem unusual for the stereotypical image of Filipinos being among the world’s happiest citizens. According to Sustainable Development Solutions Network for the United Nations, the Philippines ranked 72nd out of 155 countries in the World Happiness Report for 2017. Filipinos have been happier citizens in the past year— 10 notches higher, to be exact. Filipinos proud themselves for their resiliency and humor amidst difficulties in life but because of this, Filipinos turned a blind eye when it comes to mental illnesses to the extent of refusing the existence of it just like what “Eat Bulaga” host Joey de Leon did. The stigma surrounding mental illness only adds to the layers of struggle of people who suffer from various mental health conditions.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the Philippines, and in most parts of the world, suicide as well as depression is often misunderstood and the severe social stigma attached to them prevents people from getting help.", this is according to a report published in the "Heartbeat", the official publication of the Department of Health. 
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to World Health Organization–Philippines (WHO-PH) latest statistics, in the Philippines alone, it is estimated that 3.29 million people are living with depression. With this, it also said that depression is the leading cause of suicide and will be one of the projected leading causes of disease and injury burden by 2030, according to the 2004 WHO Global Burden of Disease Report.

(ACTIEF) building in Barangay Kalubihan, Cebu City. According to Julie Anne Caiso, 18, Villarin's classmate in Grade 11, Villarin was a happy person in school. "It’s like she doesn't have any problem," she said. But before the incident, ACTIEF President Dr. Stephen Descallar said Villarin showed erratic behavior in her class.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 2rem;">Recently, on October 8, the younger brother of 23-year-old actress/singer Nadine Lustre, Isaiah Lustre, 16, was found lifeless in their Quezon City home. CNN reports that police found an empty shell from a .38 caliber gun. Nadine's other siblings told Journal that Isaiah didn't seem to be going through any extreme problems, but they did notice how withdrawn and sad he had been, choosing to lock himself up in his room, a few days leading up to his death.</span></p><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was common for the two cases was that it could have been prevented.  It is just that, it is either the people around them choose to ignore the signs or they were ignorant of these symptoms like most of the Filipino citizens. They were already showing signs of depression but because of neglect or lack of information, they failed to stop what is to be preventable.

<div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Filipino culture encourages coping through social means. Even our language is devoid of nuances for various mental health conditions. And while such coping mechanisms cannot be discounted or done away with, there are instances or cases that require formal treatment depending on the condition. Self-diagnosis can also only worsen one’s condition.” (Tugade, 2017)</div><div><span style="font-size: 2rem;"><br></span></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 2rem;">Depression is a silent killer in the Philippines that continues to prowl at night, a killer that snatches when we are most unaware— sleeping. The creators of these nightcrawlers, killers, were us and what feeds them is our continuous neglect. What Philippines need to do is wake up, stop avoiding the inevitable by believing that Filipinos are naturally happy citizens. To open their eyes to see who Filipinos are behind the mask.</span></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filipinos are not magical beings, they are not super heroes who are immune to sadness and in fact, even superheroes like Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman are not immune to depression.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 2rem;">“On top of stigma and prejudice surrounding depression, we must acknowledge and act on the lack or inadequate funding in treating people with depression and other mental health problems,” (Ubial, 2017) What we lack the most, is weapon. Laws, programs, education, to fight against this killer we call illness.</span></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People should think and reflect before it is too late. Time is ticking and right actions can only prevent Filipinos to be a victim. A victim of depression, the people who needs our sincerest attention the most. A victim of ignorance, I believe, the most pitiful victim. They are the people who walk and talk carelessly, not knowing the consequences behind their every action. 
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a highly treatable disease and with the right mind set, reinforcement of mental health laws, we can prevent suicide cases like Jonah and Isiah.
